# Exploratory_Data_Analysis

The data set consists of health and demographic data for the period 2014-2015, obtained from Global Health Observatory Data Repository. Here is some metadata that may be useful. We take a look at the data and do an analysis on it

The project can be run on google collab or on jupyter notebook
